# chess

A browser based chessboard. Currently very few features, hopefully more to come.

## Dev
The aim of this project is to explore clojurescript, om and the supporting tools.

Please install PhantomJS for testing: http://phantomjs.org/

The project was initially created using the 
[chestnut template](https://github.com/plexus/chestnut) but I have begun to move over to 
a pure [figwheel](https://github.com/bhauman/lein-figwheel) solution for live 
reloading and [browser repl that works with Cursive](https://github.com/bhauman/lein-figwheel/wiki/Running-figwheel-in-a-Cursive-Clojure-REPL). 

In a terminal run `lein figwheel` and browse to `http://localhost:10555`
